### Our Institute
Our lab is part of the [Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology](https://ipmb.sinica.edu.tw/en) (IPMB), which has nearly 300 researchers and staff members from Taiwan and more than 15 other countries. Among the four major research areas of IPMB, we are affiliated to Plant and Environmental Microbiology (PEM) as well as Chromosome Biology and Genomics. With its four core facilities covering cell biology, microscopy, flow cytometry, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and bioinformatics, IPMB provides state-of-the-art equipment and excellent support for carrying out the best research. We, along with other IPMB labs, encourage science communication and international exchange by organizing seminars throughout the year and providing funding for attending conferences/workshops/courses and opportunities for research stays in collaborating institutes and labs.

IPMB is one of the 32 research units of [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) â€” the national research institution which is funded by Taiwanese Presidential Office and covers research fields across life sciences, physical sciences, and humanities and social sciences. Most units, including IPMB, are located in a single main campus in Taipei to facilitate interdisciplinary cooperation and discussion. Next to our campus are [National Biotechnology Research Park](https://nbrp.sinica.edu.tw/) and the Nangang transport hub combining high-speed rail, train, metro, and bus transfer stations. The Academia maintains close ties with top Taiwanese universities, which are connected through daily shuttle buses.

### Taipei, Taiwan
Our institute is located in Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan and center of the Taipei metropolitan area with a population of ~10 million. Taiwan is a mostly mountainous island state in East Asia and West Pacific, inhabited mainly by Han and Austronesian peoples and culturally influenced by neighboring countries, past colonizers, and new immigrants.
